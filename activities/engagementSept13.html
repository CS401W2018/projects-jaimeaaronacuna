    <h1>Engagement - Sept 13</h1>
    <h2><em>Jaime Aaron Acuna III</em></h2>
    <hr>

    <h2>What is the best way to make sure you 
        get a good grade on the projects?
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
        Focus more on the <strong>tags</strong> being used instead of 
        focusing more on the design of the web page.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>
        When is your project due?
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
        It is due on <strong>Monday</strong> as all projects are 
        due on Mondays.

    <h2>
        What are special entity characters?
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
        These are characters we want to display to the user but 
        have extra steps to be taken as these characters could be 
        misunderstood by HTML. These characters are presented by
        &amp;"name";.

    <h2>
        What is the difference between OL and UL Tags?
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
        <strong>OL</strong> stands ordered list, this tag is used 
        when the order of the lists matters.<br>
        <strong>UL</strong> stands for unordered list, this tag 
        us used when were just listing things 
        without consideration of its order.
