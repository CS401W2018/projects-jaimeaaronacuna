            Boxing
        </h2>
        <p>
            A type of combat sport that is strickly faught with fists. 
            Although there are many aspects to this sport, a boxing match's 
            offensive side is purely of punches which means there's no 
            slapping, grabbing, backhands, elbows, kicks, and knees. This 
            aspect has made sport focus on the science of one aspect of striking 
            which in turn made it very entertaining to watch.

            Mixed Martial Arts (MMA)
        </h2>
        <p>
            The most complete of any combat sports in terms of variations on 
            fighting styles. This sport not only even goes beyond striking and 
            includes grappling which drastically changes the way fights are faught 
            as there are new angles of attack in the offensive and there are threats 
            of takedowns on the defensive. Although the sport seems very dangerous 
            in nature, MMA is significantly safer than boxing due to the nature of 
            the rules of the sport.

        <h2>
            Muay Thai
        </h2>
        <p>
            Also sometimes referred to as Thai Boxing. This combat sport is complete 
            in all aspects of striking but does not allow any grappling (except clinches) 
            which translate to an exciting striking spectacle. The discipline is also 
            known as "The Art of Eight Limbs" as Muay Thai utilizes two hands, two elbows, 
            two knees, and two feet as its weaponry.
