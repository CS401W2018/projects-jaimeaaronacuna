                What is the difference between block tags and inline tags?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Block tags create boxes for contents to be put on, they also create a new line every time they are created, while an inline tags usually encapsulates smaller elements and is typically used for formatting and styling these elements, they also do not create a new line when they are called.

            </h2>
            <p>
                A margin is the space outside of the element, Border is the line around it, and padding is the space inside it.

                What are units of measurement you can use in CSS?
            </h2>
            <p>
                There are 2 types of unit of measurement with both of them having multiple units. One type is an Absolute unit, this unit is fixed and does not change relative to the size of other elements. Example units of this type are px, in, and pt. Another type of unit of measurement is a relative type, this changes relative to other elements. Examples for this type are %, em, and rem.
