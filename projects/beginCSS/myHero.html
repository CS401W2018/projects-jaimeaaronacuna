        <p>
            <strong>Emmanuel Dapidran Pacquiao</strong> is former professional boxer 
            from the Philippines. He has been referred to multiple times as "The Fighting 
            Pride of The Philippines" in respect to his achievements in the sport. Manny 
            is the first and only eight-division world champion, having won a world title 
            in eight different divisions. He is also the first to win a world title in four 
            of the eight original boxing weight classes. He was active in the sport for a long 
            time that he was able to become the first and only four decade world champion, having 
            won world titles in the 1990's, 2000's, 2010's, and 2020's. Manny has many more 
            accolades in the sport and he is my hero because of his origin. Coming from a life 
            so deprived of resources that he had to fight every Sunday to earn an equivalent of 
            $2 just so he can afford some medicine for his mom has taught me that my situtaion 
            is almost never an excuse to not grow in life. Yes, Manny is in the 99.99% percentile 
            in terms achievements and origin difference, but his perserverance has showed that 
            results are almost always expected when we strive for our goals.
