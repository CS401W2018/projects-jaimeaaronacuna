        <h3>
            Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?
        </h3>
        <p>
            An absolute link i a link to another website with its official link. 
            While a relative link is a link to relative pages of my website using file directory links. 
            It is preferrable to use relative link on navigating on the same website so that 
            it would be much easier to translate if my domain name is changed.
