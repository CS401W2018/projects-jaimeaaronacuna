                    Max Verstappen is a Dutch Formula 1 driver, born September 30, 1997, in Hasselt, Belgium. Debuting in 2015, He made history for being the youngest driver to compete in a Grand Prix at just 17 years old. Being a prodigy coupled with his aggresive style of driving made him an instant star in the world of Formula 1 racing.

                    Max dominated the Formula 2023 season gaining notable highlight stats of 9 fastest laps, 1003 laps led, 12 pole positions, and 21 podiums with 19 of those being wins and accumulating a very impressive 575 points. this dominant performance was elevated upon the consideration of who he was competing with. Lewis Hamilton, regarded by most as the greatest Formula 1 driver of all time, was only able to finish with 234 that season, less than half of Max's. Being as young as he is now, Max surely has way more wins ahead of his career.
