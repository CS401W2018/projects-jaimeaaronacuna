        <h2>What you learned about Flex and CSS.</h2>
        <p>
            I learn how to align and justify contents as well as manipulating their order to be able to arrange my contents in whatever way I can.
        </p>

        <h2>Why do you need to have an accessible website? What does that mean?</h2>
        <p>
            It is needed because it is for compliance of the law and in a business sense, it would allow for more people to use your website which could possibly translate to more revenue. Accessible means providing access to people with disability.
