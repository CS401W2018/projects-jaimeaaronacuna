        <h3>
            Explain the difference between inline, embedded, and external CSS.
        </h3>
        <p>
            Inline CSS is put in the specific tags that is being designed.<br>
            Embedded CSS is coded in a desegnated style tag in the head tag.<br>
            External CSS is coded on a different file and is linked from the html file.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Explain why you should only use external CSS.
        </h3>
        <p>
            External CSS saves a lot of time in working with big websites and it also allows designers to have a desegnated file to work on without the need to be proficient in html.

            What is a selector used for?
        </h3>
        <p>
            The selector is used to specify which tag is going to be affected by the css style block.
